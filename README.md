# 25-Simple-Image-Slider-Manual-HTML-Version-
Description

This project demonstrates a basic image slider built with pure HTML and a touch of CSS. It’s a great way to showcase photos or banners without using JavaScript.
Features

    Clean layout with smooth transitions
    Lightweight and JavaScript-free

Explanation

This slider works by:

    Using radio inputs to control which image is shown
    Shifting the .slides container with transform: translateX(...)
